## Task Delegation  
Tasks were delegated to each team member based on their strengths and interests. Team members were also encouraged to select tasks from the trello To do list, that they we interested in learning more about.If there was a taks that a team member was not confident in completing, they were encouraged to ask for help from the other team members during the daily stand up.

## Project management
For this project we have decided to use the Agile methodology for project management. This will see the quick completion of tasks, daily stand ups of what tasks have been completed and will be completed in the next 24 hours, and flexibility to changes to the requirements of the project.

This will be managed is Trello, a Kanban style project management tool, where individual tasks are noted on separate cards. Each card will have properties to determine which member of the group it is assigned to, when it is due, and the estimated time to complete the task. Within the cards there are also sub-lists, to further breakdown the tasks and allow for incremental progress to be seen.
